# React Intro


_Q_: From doing the warmup, what is React?
_Q_: You've probably been to a restaraunt that has too many items on their menu vs a restaraunt that has just a few items on their menu. What was your experience like? What are the pros and cons of these restaraunts?

Let's look at some examples of React on the web. E.g. Figma, facebook, slack.

_Q_: What commonalities can you find between these applications that use React?

Manage a lot of state (data), complicated applications, etc.

_Q_: What is UI? And how important are the UI in these examples?

So Why React? And why were these different web applications built with React?

We've built our own UI in the past few weeks. For example the NASA photo of the day.

_Q_: How painful was doing plain DOM manipulation to build components?


Very. Code can get quite repetetive and hard to reason about as you build bigger components.

Before react came around, there were several single page application framework that were great. Angular1.x for example was very popular at the time, and was very good at getting a project up and going. However it was easy to take on technical debt as the project grew in complexity.

This is when engineers at facebook came up with React. It wasn't a framework, but a UI library. It is much less opinionated and simple to use. It focused primarily on addressing one problem, which was UI.

Have you ever been to a restauraunt that has too many items on their menu?
