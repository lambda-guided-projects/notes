# Advanced Styling

### CRA
A big hurdle to learning react is setting up the tooling. To address this React team provided CRA.
Run `$ npx create-react-app reactstrap-demo --use-npm`

There's A LOT of different ways to style in React. We are going to explore two different ways today.

Depending on the technical constraints, business requirements, or resources available you might choose one
solution over the other. There's no right way, in the end comes down finding the best tool for the job and to preferences.

The first solution we are going to explore is: Reactstrap

## Reactstrap is a component library. 

_Q_: What is a component library?

Reactstrap is a library with pre-build components styled with bootstrap and ready to use out of the box.

_Q_: Why would you want to or not want to use a component library like 'Reactstrap'?

Opportunity to review useEffect, useState, and possibly explore fetch or async/await.


## Styled Components

Talk about how vanilla css in js in react looks like and talk about it's constraints.

This is the other solution we will explore. Easier maintenance of CSS with components. Fully embraces
component architecture.

1. Create a styled component
2. Using props
3. Extending a component
4. pseudo selectors like hover and animations
4. Themeing
